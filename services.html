<li>Travel Management</li>
<p> would be the core function and the one which agencies engaged in organising business travel have always performed. 
This area of services would include the management and reservation of transport tickets, searches for accommodations, 
car rentals, etc.
</p>


 <li>Passenger assistance</li>
<p> a trip there may be many unforeseen problems and issues which need to be resolved: repatriation due to illness,
 accident or emergency, lost luggage or documents, etc.
</p>

<li>Consulting</li>
<p>Consulting services include a large number of aspects which are related, more or less directly, 
with travel: information of interest for the traveller (customs of the country of destination, recommendations on 
behaviour, etc.), cost optimisation and control, advice on travel policies, etc.
</p>

<li>Marketing and internal communication</li>   
<p>Due to its experience, a travel management agency can be very helpful in preparing travel policies for
 companies (rules regarding expenses, management of per diems, etc.), as well as its proper and effective
 communication to the employees.  
</p>


<li>Technology</li> 
<p>The proper and constantly updated use of technology is vital, not only for the requesting and comparison of 
travel services (tickets, accommodation, etc.) but also for such diverse aspects as billing management or locating 
travellers in extreme situations.
</p>


<li>Leisure Services</li>
<p>In some cases, some travel management companies offer direct discounts or improved conditions on travel and leisure 
activities for the employees and their relatives at the companies for which they work.

With the comprehensive management of corporate travel, travel management companies achieve the goal of giving 
added value to their service, which is essential in order to meet the current expectations and needs of companies.
